2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell mono_pulse_if_reset/program_cnt[3]_i_3, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) instruction_fetching/program_cnt_reg[0]/CLR, instruction_fetching/program_cnt_reg[1]/CLR, instruction_fetching/program_cnt_reg[2]/CLR, instruction_fetching/program_cnt_reg[3]/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
